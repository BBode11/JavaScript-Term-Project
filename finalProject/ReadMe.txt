The following website includes four pages including a simple homepage.
As of right now each page has the same scheme and style. The idea behind the website is to provide fun and interactive games for younger kids to play.
The games included will be a monster creator which will be a simple drag and drop game where kids can create their own monsters with png images.
The second game is called monster dash and the user will have to guide a monster through obstacles in order to reach a new high score.
The last game is going to be called monster hunter. In the game the user is going to have to click and shoot the monsters as they appear on the screen.

Monster Creator: Click and drag items to build your own monster.
Monster Dash: Use the arrow keys to guide your monster through the obstacles. The goal is to get the biggest high score.
Monster Hunt: Game starts fast! See if you can shoot all 20 monsters before they run off the screen
