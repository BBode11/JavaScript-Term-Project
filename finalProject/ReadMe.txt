The following website includes four pages including a simple homepage.
As of right now each page has the same scheme and style. The idea behind the website is to provide fun and interactive games for younger kids to play.
The games included will be a monster creator which will be a simple drag and drop game where kids can create their own monsters with png images.
The second game as of right now is going to be a memory game where they have to match the monsters together as fast as they can.
The last game is going to be called monster hunter. In the game the user is going to have to click and shoot the monsters as they appear on the screen.
