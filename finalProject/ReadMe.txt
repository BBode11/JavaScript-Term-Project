The following website includes four pages including a simple homepage.
As of right now each page has the same scheme and style. The idea behind the website is to provide fun and interactive games for younger kids to play.
The games included will be a monster creator which will be a simple drag and drop game where kids can create their own monsters with png images.
The second game is called monster dash and the user will have to guide a monster through obstacles in order to reach a new high score.
The last game is going to be called monster hunter. In the game the user is going to have to click and shoot the monsters as they appear on the screen.
